# Social-Network-API

## Description
    The Social Network API is a Node.js application programming interface (API) enabling users to execute CRUD operations on data models related to social networking. These models, encompassing friends, users, thoughts, and reactions, can be retrieved either by ID or collectively. Constructed with Node.js and Mongoose, the API offers a straightforward and scalable approach to managing social networking data, free from the constraints of conventional relational databases.
